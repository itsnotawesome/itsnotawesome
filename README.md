# Hey, I'm Alexander 👋 👨‍💻
I'm an IoT developer on my way to becoming a **backend developer**. My journey into the world of backend development began in 2022, when I embarked on the exciting path of learning a new profession. I am currently deep diving into **Java**. Beyond backend development, I'm also exploring the realms of devops, computer science, and data science. The tech landscape is vast, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge. I believe in the power of community. Just as technology brings people together, I enjoy creating connections and building communities. Like my passion for backend development, fostering collaboration is central to my mission. 🏎 When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me cheering for my favorite Formula 1 team. I'm a huge fan, and the high-speed world of F1 fuels my enthusiasm.
